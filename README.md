# MPhil-Code
Code used to complete the research I've done for my masters of Philosophy at Adelaide University

Included in this repository is:

1. The code I used to fit the coupling constants of the QMC model to the binding of Lambda hyperons, as in chapter 3 of my thesis. This was done using the Numerov algorithm, and done in Jupyter notebook.
2. The code I used to calculate the binding energy of Cascade hyperons, as in chapter 4 of my thesis. This was also done using the Numerov algorithm, and in a Jupyter notebook.
3. Code to calculate the mean value of the sigma meson field, when considering a Sigma hyperon bound in Helium nucleus. Once again using the Numerov algorithm and done using a Jupyter notebook.
4. Fortran code to calculate the shift in the energy levels in Iron and Carbon nuclei, when considering the binding of a cascade nucleus.
5. The values for the finite Coulomb potential for Iron and Carbon nuclei, contained in a compressed file. There are instructions in the fortran files on how to calculate these yourself if you so wish to do so instead.
